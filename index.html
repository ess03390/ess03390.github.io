    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p> I am from Atlanta, GA and I attended the Lovett School. I am a Freshman at UGA majoring in Marketing and minoring in Fashion Merchandising. In my free time I like to hang out with my friends, workout, and volunteer. I have had a fantastic first year at Georgia filled with new friends and many memories. I am so sad that in only two weeks the year will be over! </p>
    <h2> I have a great family!</h2>
